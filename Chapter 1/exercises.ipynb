    "\n",
    "1. **How would you define Machine Learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    After reading the definitions given by the book,\n",
    "    I'm inclined to give a more mathematical definition\n",
    "    of machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "    _Machine Learning_ is the study of how a computer program $P$\n",
    "    can complete a task $T$ with data $E$ without explicit programing.\n",
    "    Explicit programs of a task $T$ can be defined as programs\n",
    "    which do not depend on $E$ to function. Generally, the goal of \n",
    "    the program is to improve its score in completeing task $T$\n",
    "    with respect to data $E$ efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Can you name four types of problems where it shines?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Problems which require attention to huge amounts of fine details.\n",
    "    2. Problems which are too complex to solve through normal algorithms, \n",
    "        or which rely on data that humans cannot understand.\n",
    "    3. Problems which fluctuate as new data must be incorporated.\n",
    "    4. Problems which can be better understood through analyzing \n",
    "        the behavior and decisions of machine learning techniques.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What is a labeled training set?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    A labeled training set is an assignment of data points to their class.\n",
    "    For example, if we had a training set of animals, we could label each \n",
    "    animal as _Bee_ or _Not Bee_.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What are the two most common supervised tasks?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. _Classification_: Given data $E$ divided into discrete categories $C$,\n",
    "        predict the category of new data.\n",
    "    2. _Regression_: Given data $E$ which map to continuous quantities (often \n",
    "        a real number), predict a target numberic value of new data.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Clustering data into groups without any prior knowledge about relations within the data.\n",
    "    2. Anomaly detection and novelty detection.\n",
    "    3. Visualization and dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "    4. Asscociation rule learning. (e.g. learning association between words like \"White House,\" \"US President,\" and \"Joe Biden.\")\n",
    "<br/><br/> \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **What type of Machine Learning algorithm wouldyou use to allow a robot to walk in various unknown terrains?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reinforement Learning, because the robot needs to learn by interacting with the enviorment and figuring out what are good vs bad actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple groups?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    A clustering algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning problem or an unsupervised learning problem?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Supervised, because the algorithm needs to have many examples of what spam is to function.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **What is an online learning system?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    A learning system that trains incrementally on new data as it comes in. Great for systems which have a continuous flow of incoming data.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **What is out-of-core learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The algorithm doesn't train on its own main memory because the data is too large, so it must train on other machines or split the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **What type of learning algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make predictions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Instance-based learning algorithm. New instances are compared to other instances based on a metric. \n",
    "\n",
    "12. **What is the difference between a model parameter and a learning algorithmâ€™s hyperparameter?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    A hyperparameter is a value set by the researcher which the model cannot modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **What do model-based learning algorithms search for? What is the most common strategy they use to succeed? How do they make predictions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    They search for trends within huge amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Can you name four of the main challenges in Machine Learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Nonrepresetnative training data. Data with biases.\n",
    "    2. Poor quality data. Maybe your data is representative, but it is full of errors and noise.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **If your model performs great on the training data but generalizes poorly to new instances, what is happening? Can you name three possible solutions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. You may be overfitting on your training data.\n",
    "    2. You may be underfitting you training data.\n",
    "    3. You may have a bunch of garbage features in your training data that is not reflected in new instances.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **What is a test set, and why would you want to use it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    A set put aside from the training data in the beginning. You want to test on this set in the end to see if your model generalizes well.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **What is the purpose of a validation set?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you train the model on the test set and tune hyperparameters on the test set, then you may bias the model towards the test set. The validation set is a subset of the training set you tune your hyperparameters on, holding out on fully testing a final model until the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **What is the train-dev set, when do you need it, and how do you use it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Biases in the training set may cause mismatches with real world data. Hence we hold out yet another set -- the train-dev set -- to test in parallel with the dev set. If the model preforms well on one but not the other, then the data being used is probably faulty, so you should try to clean up or obtain more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. **What can go wrong if you tune hyperparameters using the test set?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can overfit on the test set."
