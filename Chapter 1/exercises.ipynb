    "1. **How would you define Machine Learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    After reading the definitions given by the book,\n",
    "    I'm inclined to give a more mathematical definition\n",
    "    of machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "    _Machine Learning_ is the study of how a computer program $P$\n",
    "    can complete a task $T$ with data $E$ without explicit programing.\n",
    "    Explicit programs of a task $T$ can be defined as programs\n",
    "    which do not depend on $E$ to function. Generally, the goal of \n",
    "    the program is to improve its score in completeing task $T$\n",
    "    with respect to data $E$ efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Can you name four types of problems where it shines?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Problems which require attention to huge amounts of fine details.\n",
    "    2. Problems which are too complex to solve through normal algorithms, \n",
    "        or which rely on data that humans cannot understand.\n",
    "    3. Problems which fluctuate as new data must be incorporated.\n",
    "    4. Problems which can be better understood through analyzing \n",
    "        the behavior and decisions of machine learning techniques.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What is a labeled training set?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    A labeled training set is an assignment of data points to their class.\n",
    "    For example, if we had a training set of animals, we could label each \n",
    "    animal as _Bee_ or _Not Bee_.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What are the two most common supervised tasks?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. _Classification_: Given data $E$ divided into discrete categories $C$,\n",
    "        predict the category of new data.\n",
    "    2. _Regression_: Given data $E$ which map to continuous quantities (often \n",
    "        a real number), predict a target numberic value of new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "    2. Classification/Regression\n",
    "    3. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **What type of Machine Learning algorithm would you use to allow a robot to \n",
    "walk in various unknown terrains?**\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple groups?**\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning prob‐\n",
    "lem or an unsupervised learning problem?**\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **What is an online learning system?**\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **What is out-of-core learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **What type of learning algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make predic‐\n",
    "tions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **What is the difference between a model parameter and a learning algorithm’s\n",
    "hyperparameter?**\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **What do model-based learning algorithms search for? What is the most common\n",
    "strategy they use to succeed? How do they make predictions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Can you name four of the main challenges in Machine Learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **If your model performs great on the training data but generalizes poorly to new\n",
    "instances, what is happening? Can you name three possible solutions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **What is a test set, and why would you want to use it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **What is the purpose of a validation set?**\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **What is the train-dev set, when do you need it, and how do you use it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "19. **What can go wrong if you tune hyperparameters using the test set?**"
