# Hands On Machine Learning

### What is the goal of this project?

I want to learn machine learning as fast as possible, because of its usefulness
in basically any field of computer science. I want to finish this project in
one semester with a deeper understanding of the past, present, and future developments
in machine learning. I want to finish this project with a few machine learning projects
built from scratch that I can show off. In the short term, I suppose all of this needs
to contribute to my employability regarding internships. However, in the long term,
I hope this project will become the solid foundation from which I build and create 
the rest of my machine learning knowledge. 

To myself, godspeed.
